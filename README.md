# 624-Scouting-Manager

## Introduction 
This is the code for the 624 Scouting Manager, part of the 624 Scouting system. The purpose of the 624 Scouting Manager is to automatically generate a schedule compatable with the 624 Scouting Apps as well as automatically merge collected data to a single CSV.

## Requirements
This application requires that Python 3 be installed on the computer. Once you have installed Python 3, simply download the MSI file from the releases folder and install it. I promise it isn't a virus.

## Guide
Once you have installed all the necessary components, you can proceed to use the 624 Scouting Manager.

### Select Python Engine
Using the file navigator, select the python.exe file from your computer. This should always be the first step as the other options will not execute without it.

### Import Data
WIP: More testing needs to be done in regards to how a tablet is mounted by Windows.

### Generate Schedule
For this option, you will need 2 things: Your TBA v3 API key and the event code. The API key can be aquired on your TBA account page. For the event code, it is the year of the event combined with the code that appears when searching up an event in TBA. For example, the 2019 Newton divison event code would be 2019new. Note that the code should be lowercase.
